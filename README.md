# Recursion-Fun
An exercise that turns any string of text (characters only), into a single word camel case string recursivelsy.

Another part of this exercise executes a treasure hunt to determine if the recursive sum of randomly generated digits (flashlights) is equal to an assigned value of caves. If they are equal, treasure is found!
